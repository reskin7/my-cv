            I consider myself a proactive and responsible person with good
            communication skills. After a few years working in project
            management I have decided to return to the technical area as QA and,
            at the same time, train as a frontend developer (React), bringing
            the knowledge and soft skills acquired in my experience during
            project leadership.
